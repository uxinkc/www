										<div class="col-md-9 text-justify">
											<p>Building the Cerner Digital Experience team and pursuing the Cerner.com website redesign was a monolith project, with a vision to bring Cerner back to the forefront of enterprise Health Care IT. The only thing preventing a billion dollar company from realizing this vision was getting 20+ senior executives to come together and agree. It sounds simple enough, but as my team discovered, company politics were at the core of this digital stagnation.</p>
                      <p>Along with developing a content and feature rich blog of insights, the major design initiative was developing a best-in-class web experience that could drive multiple customer types down a path and into the sales pipeline. To prove the value of what my team delivering I developed the vision of our <strong>"Clicks to Dollars"</strong> initiative, which surfaced the ROI of digital experience excellence to Cerner executive leadership.</p>

									<div class="row gx-0">
										<div class="col-md-9 text-justify">
											<p>For over 6 years, the Cerner.com website and overall digital experience practice was either non-existant or a hinderance to sale executives. The presence of <strong>Cerner digital properties were severely outdated, unmaintainable, and were disassociated</strong> will all social media and solutions marketing initiatives. There was no team nor experienced individuals running strategic efforts in the digital experience space, creating a major blindspot for sales and marketing. Lastly, <strong>gaining senior executive support and buy-in</strong> would be extremely difficult but critical for the success of our initiatives.</p>
